We have three tables in this example:

- for the `diamonds` data, we can select variables to show in the table;

- for the `mtcars` example, we use `bSortClasses = TRUE` so that sorted
  columns are colored since they have special CSS classes attached;

- for the `iris` data, we customize the length menu so we can display 5 rows
  per page;
